      <p>
        Are you ready for a serious and gainful career? Well stop flinging your potential out the window like a damn dirty ape. Answer a few simple questions&mdash;for example, do you like cheese? What kind of animal would you be? <em>Can you recite the national anthem backwards??</em>&mdash;and this highly intelligent test will tell you whether and which programming language is right for you.

        Your friends are smart humans. They wouldn't lie to you, would they? Good coding starts with a good work ethic, and you are committed to the goals you set your mind to. It isn't really that much more complicated than that. It doesn't matter which language you choose. You will never know what is best for you until you try it. So quit monkeying around and make it happen!

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)#Comparisons_to_other_languages" target="_blank">Swift was developed by Apple</a> to update its Objective-C language (which dates to the 1980s). As an alternative, Swift is simpler in its syntax than Objective-C in the same way that jQuery is simpler than vanilla JavaScript.</li>
        <li><a href="https://gbksoft.com/blog/swift-vs-objective-c/" target="_blank">Some say that Swift is one of the fastest growing programming languages</a>. That's because most iOS apps were written in Objective-C, a now-dated language that Swift replaced. If you want to program mobile apps, Swift is probably your best bet.</li>
        <li>See what the dev community is saying about Swift on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://blog.railwaymen.org/13-best-mobile-applications-written-in-swift" target="_blank">Most applications for Swift</a> are, unsurprisingly, part of the iOS mobile app ecosystem. They include <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linkedin-network-job-finder/id288429040" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asana-organize-tasks-work/id489969512" target="_blank">Asana</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lyft/id529379082" target="_blank">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/sky-guide/id576588894" target="_blank">Sky Guide</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kickstarter/id596961532" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.
